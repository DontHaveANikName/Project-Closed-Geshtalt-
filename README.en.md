## Brief description

The Closed Gestalt Project is a project in which I am implementing one project in each of the fields that I tried to study in my school years. In this way, I am closing the gestalt and finding out what I have learned during all this time.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to make one completed project in the following fields:

* Music
* Game development
* Drawing comics
* Writing books
* Website development

## Branches

Each branch will have its own branch where I will keep my project.

I also want to note that the projects were developed from 01.06.2023 to 04.02.2024. Therefore, they were divided into two stages:

First stage: from June 01, 2023 to September 01, 2023. At this stage, the basis of the project was created, i.e. all projects were created, but they were not edited and finalized.
    
Second stage: from 01.10.2023 to 04.02.2024. At this stage, all projects were edited and finalized.

Therefore, the repository is also divided into two parts: the branch of projects created before 01.09 and the branch of projects created before 04.02.

* [**01.09**](01.09/) - branch developed from 01.06 to 01.09

  * [**Music branch**](01.09/Music) is a music writing project.
  
  * [**Visual Novel Branch**](01.09//Visual_Novel/) is a project for developing a visual novel.
  
  * [**Comics branch**](01.09/Comics/) is a comic book project.
  
  * [**Branch book**](01.09/Book/) is a book writing project.
  
  * [**Site branch**](01.09/Site/) is a website development project.

* [**04.02**](04.02/) - a branch developed from 01.10 to 04.02

  * [**Music branch**](04.02//Music) is a music writing project.
  
  * [**Visual novel branch**](04.02//Visual_Novel/) is a project for developing a visual novel.
  
  * [**Comics branch**](04.02/Comics/) is a comic book project.
  
  * [**Branch book**](04.02/Book/) is a book writing project.
